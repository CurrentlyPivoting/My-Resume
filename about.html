    <h1>About me, and some of my interests</h1>
        <p>I have numerous interests. One of my biggest interests is a continuation of learning. If I come across something that I find interesting, I tend to want to know how to do it myself. Whether that is hand forging tools, to baking bread, or anything in between. I love to learn.</p>

    <h2>Some of my other interests are:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Nearly anything outdoors. Jogging, walking, hiking, backpacking, or anything that gets me outside.</li>
            <li>Golfing. I'm terrible at the game of golf. However, I truly enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Working with, and raising animals.</li>
            <li>Exploring new areas.</li>
            <li>Jeeping. Driving into really remote areas.</li>
            <li>Camping.</li>
            <li>Shooting sports.</li>


        </ul>
